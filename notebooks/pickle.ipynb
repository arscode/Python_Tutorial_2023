    "\n",
    "The following types can be serialized and deserialized using the Pickle module:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All native datatypes supported by Python (booleans, None, integers, floats, complex numbers, strings, bytes, byte arrays)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dictionaries, sets, lists, and tuples - as long as they contain pickleable objects\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions and classes that are defined at the top level of a module\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that pickling is not a language-independent serialization method, therefore your pickled data can only be unpickled using Python. Moreover, it's important to make sure that objects are pickled using the same version of Python that is going to be used to unpickle them. Mixing Python versions, in this case, can cause many problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, functions are pickled by their name references, and not by their value. The resulting pickle does not contain information on the function's code or attributes. Therefore, you have to make sure that the environment where the function is unpickled is able to import the function. In other words, if we pickle a function and then unpickle it in an environment where it's either not defined or not imported, an exception will be raised."
